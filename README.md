# Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)

This is a Power BI dashboard I created to explore how data can help banks take better decisions while approving or rejecting loan applications. The idea was to look at different customer-related data and try to figure out if someone is a risky customer or not.

---

## What‚Äôs the project about?

The main goal of this dashboard is to understand **loan approval risks** and how banks can use **data to reduce chances of money loss**. I used a dataset that includes client info like banking history, gender, advisor details, and engagement period.

---

## What‚Äôs in the dataset?

There were multiple tables in the dataset, like:
- Client banking details
- Gender info
- Investment advisor
- Relationship details
- Period of engagement

I had to clean and transform the data a bit. For example, I created a new column called **Engagement Timeframe** to calculate how long a client has been associated with the bank.

## What I built in the dashboard

- Loan approval based on client risk profile
- Visuals showing repayment capacity
- Segmentation based on gender, advisor, and client type
- Filters to play around with data

It‚Äôs a simple dashboard but gives a good idea of how banks can use visuals and numbers to make better decisions.

##  Tools I used

- **Power BI** (main tool for building the dashboard)
- **Excel** (used to explore the dataset before loading)
- A bit of **SQL-style thinking** to understand relationships between tables

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to run the dashboard

1. Download and install **Power BI Desktop** (if you haven‚Äôt already)
2. Open the `.pbix` file from this repo
3. That‚Äôs it! You can now explore the dashboard

## What I learned

- Got better at **Power BI**
- Learned how to connect multiple tables with relationships
- Realized how important it is to clean and transform data before visualizing it

---

## What can be added next?

- Predictive ML model to score loan risk
- Real-time data connection via API
